\chapter{Introduction}

In recent times, the emergence of deep learning has brought about a significant transformation in the field of computer vision, marking a shift in how machines interpret visual information. The fusion of artificial intelligence and neural network structures, particularly the multi-layered configurations of deep neural networks, has fundamentally changed the landscape of visual processing. At the core of deep learning is its ability to independently learn hierarchical representations from raw data, making it a powerful tool for addressing intricate visual tasks that were previously considered insurmountable. The impact of this approach extends beyond mere image recognition, influencing various sectors such as robotics, healthcare, security, and entertainment.

In the context of deep learning for computer vision, a pivotal moment occurred in 2012 when \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} introduced their work, now known as AlexNet, a groundbreaking convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This innovative architecture marked a new era by significantly surpassing traditional methods in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge~\citep{ILSVRC15}. This accomplishment not only showcased the effectiveness of deep learning in image classification but also ignited a substantial increase in research and development within the field. Successive architectures, including VGGNet~\citep{Simonyan15}, GoogLeNet~\citep{szegedy2015going}, ResNet~\citep{he2016deep}, and ViT~\citep{kolesnikov2021an}, played a crucial role in advancing accuracy and scalability, solidifying deep learning as the cornerstone of modern computer vision.

As we explore the vast realm of deep learning, it is crucial to acknowledge its impact on diverse applications where the ability to interpret visual information has become essential. Autonomous systems, driven by deep learning algorithms, now navigate intricate environments with unprecedented precision and adaptability. In medical imaging, deep learning aids in identifying anomalies, improving diagnostic accuracy, and potentially revolutionizing patient care. Biometric systems, supported by advanced neural networks, redefine security protocols, while augmented reality experiences benefit from the seamless integration of deep learning for object recognition and scene understanding.

The interaction between deep learning and computer vision goes beyond task optimization; instead, it signifies a symbiotic relationship that continually evolves to address emerging challenges. As we embark on this exploration, we will unravel the multifaceted dimensions of deep learning, from its foundational architectures to its integration with three-dimensional understanding, showcasing its transformative potential in reshaping the future of visual intelligence.
